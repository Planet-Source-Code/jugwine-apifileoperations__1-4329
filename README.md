## APIFileOperations


</div>

### Description

I think I took some of this from the MSDN, and made major mods to it. Now, when compiled, the developer can simply set a few properties, and call the methods to do windows standard file operations. it will do a copy, move, delete and rename, and where appropriate will bring up the standard windows dialog boxes, complete with the little animations, etc...
 
### More Info
 
Just how to instantiate objects, set their properties and call their methods... Don't forget to register it with regsvr32 (put the provided dll in c:\windows\system\, then open a command line and type regsvr32 c:\windows\desktop\APIFileOperations2.dll)

None that I know of. Shouldn't be any reason for problems..
